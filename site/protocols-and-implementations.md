# Protocols and Implementations

Autonomous Data is only an architecture. In order to develop Autonomous Data applications, a protocol that supports this architecture must be used. There are basically two things that these protocols need to support: authentication/authorization and data formats.

These are the protocols that are suitable to develop Autonomous Data applications:

- [Solid](https://solid.mit.edu) is a protocol based on Semantic Web technologies. It's been created by the people behind W3C and their philosophy and message is very aligned with Autonomous Data.

- [Kinko](https://github.com/noeldemartin/kinko) is the implementation that was started with the incubation of Autonomous Data. Its development is currently paused, but it can serve as a good example of how to embrace the architecture with different technologies.

If there is anything else you think should be added to this list [let us know](https://github.com/noeldemartin/autonomous-data/issues/new).
